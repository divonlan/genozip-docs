Licensing - Frequently Asked Questions
======================================

**Can I use Genozip for free?**

The :ref:`Genozip License <license>` defines the exact cases for which use of Genozip is free. To illustrate, here are some examples:

*Examples of applications for which use of Genozip is FREE:*

- Academic: You are conducing a study, with the primary objective being publishing the results in a scientific journal.
  
- Training: You are teaching a course in bioinformatics, using Genozip to teach data compression.

- Evaluation: You may use Genozip for 30 days to see whether Genozip fits your needs, ahead of a decision of whether to purchase a license.

- Decompression: decompressing files previously compressed with Genozip is free.

- Distribution: Distributing the Genozip software to others, for example, as a module on an HPC, is free. Each user will need to register individually.

*Examples of applications that require paying a licensing fee:*

- Clinical: The genomic data is used to directly benefit the individuals who provided the samples, for example via better diagnosis or treatment.

- Product: You are developing a product, such as a pharmaceutical or food product. 

- Service: You are providing a service to your customers, such as DNA sequencing, DNA analysis, bioinformatics, SaaS or cloud.

**You made your source code public, can't anyone just compile it and use it, without paying?**

When using Genozip to compress their precious genomic data, users are trusting us with their data for the long term, and we want do our best to ensure that the data is still accessible in 20, 50 or 100 years time. This is one of the reasons we develop in C - a language that has been around for 50 years, and this is why we make the source code public. The likelihood that our code, as is, will still compile on future computers, decades from now, is high. 

When making this decision, we were well aware that we will inevitabley encounter dishonest users who will shoplift our product without paying. Unfortunately, this indeed happens - we see users who register with fake details, or users that claim that their use case is academic while in fact it is clinical.

How does it make us feel? In one word - cheated. Just like anyone would feel after spending days, nights and weekends working on a project, just to see their employer or customer wiggle out of their obligation to pay.

Luckily, our license does give us recourse against shoplifters in the form of 20% ownership in all revenue generated and intellectual property created involving shoplifted Genozip, and the ability execute on this right at any point in the future.

**I am a compression researcher. May I benchmark my software against Genozip?**

Yes! We love respectful competition. There is nothing like competition to drive technological progress.
