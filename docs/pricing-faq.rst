Licensing - Frequently Asked Questions
======================================

**Can I use Genozip for free?**

The :ref:`Genozip License <license>` defines the exact cases for which use of Genozip is free. To illustrate, here are some examples:

*Examples of applications for which use of Genozip is FREE:*

- Academic: You are conducing a study, with the primary objective being publishing the results in a scientific journal.
  
- Training: You are teaching a course in bioinformatics, using Genozip to teach data compression.

- Evaluation: You may use Genozip for 30 days to see whether Genozip fits your needs, ahead of a decision of whether to purchase a license.

- Decompression: decompressing files previously compressed with Genozip is free.

- Distribution: Distributing the Genozip software to others, for example, as a module on an HPC, is free. Each user will need to register individually.

*Examples of applications that require paying a licensing fee:*

- Clinical: The genomic data is used to directly benefit the individuals who provided the samples, for example via better diagnosis or treatment.

- Clinical + Research: The genomic data is used to directly benefit the individuals who provided the samples, for example via better diagnosis or treatment, and you are also using the data to conduct scientific research.

- Product: You are developing a product, such as a pharmaceutical or food product. 

- Service: You are providing a service to your customers, such as DNA sequencing, DNA analysis, bioinformatics, SaaS or cloud.

**You made your source code public, can't anyone just compile it and use it, without paying?**

When using Genozip to compress their precious genomic data, users are trusting us with their data for the long term, and we want to do our best to ensure that the data is still accessible in 20, 50 or 100 years time. This is one of the reasons we develop in C - a stable language in which the kernels of Linux, MacOS and Windows are written, and this is why we make the source code public. The likelihood that our code will still be available and compile on future computers, decades from now, is high. 

In other words, our code is available so anyone can inspect it and gain confidence in the product, as well as to ensure that files compressed with Genozip are still decompressible decades ahead. However, using the code is still subject to the specified license, that requires paying a licensing fee in some cases.

We know that by "leaving our shop open and unattended" we will inevitabley encounter dishonest shoplifters who are supposed to pay us for using our product but prefer to save a few dollars by cheating a small business like us. That's their choice. 

**I am a compression researcher. May I benchmark my software against Genozip?**

Yes! We love competition. There is nothing like competition to drive technological progress.
