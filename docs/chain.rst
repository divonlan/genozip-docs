**Obtaining a chain file**

Here is a non-exhaustive list of chain files (also called LiftOver files). The creators of these chain files are not associated with Genozip in any way, and Genozip does not endorse, recommend or warrant the correctness of any particular file.

`From Ensembl <https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/assembly_mapping/>`_

`From UCSC <https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html>`_

**Chain file format**

The file format of chain files can be found here: `UCSC chain file format <https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/chain.html>`_. 

**--chain: Chain files and Genozip**

Chain files are compressable with Genozip:

::

    genozip GRCh37_to_GRCh38.chain 

To make the compressed Chain files useable with ``genozip --chain`` to :ref:`lift a VCF file<dvcf>`, two reference files are required - the reference genome in Primary coordinates, and the reference genome in Luft coordintes, for example:

::

    genozip GRCh37_to_GRCh38.chain --reference hs37d5.ref.genozip --reference GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.ref.genozip

**--match-chrom-to-reference: Fix mismatching contigs** 

It is an unfortunate reality of the current state of bioinformatics, that multiple references exist with differing names for the same contigs. For example, some human references may have a contig called "22" while other references call the same contig "chr22". Likewise chain files may map between any combinations of these options. Moreover, a chain file may refer to contigs that are absent in the specific reference used.

To address this problem, Genozip provides the option ``--match-chrom-to-reference`` that updates contig names to match those in the specified references, and removes alignments of contigs that don't appear in the references:

::

    genozip GRCh37_to_GRCh38.chain --match-chrom-to-reference --reference hs37d5.ref.genozip --reference GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.ref.genozip

**--show-chain: Viewing chain file alignments**

To view the alignment in the chain, use ``--show-chain``:

Column 1 is the sequential number of this alignment.

Columns 2,3,4 are coordinates in the Primary reference genome and columns 5,6,7 are coordinates in the Luft reference genome. Note that these are 1-based coordinates (as in VCF), whereas the Chain file format has 0-based coordinates. 

Column 8 contains an ``X`` if the range in the Luft reference is reverse complimented.

Column 9 contains the ALN_I of an alignment with an overlapping Luft range: This is for cases in which multiple alignments contain overlapping Luft ranges. If this alignment's Luft range overlaps with the Luft range of more than one other alignment, the column will contain one of them.

**--show-chain-contigs: Viewing chain file contig information**

    PRIMARY chain file contigs that also exist in the reference file:
