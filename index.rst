Genozip
=======
*A universal compressor for genomic files*
            
Genozip is a universal compressor for genomic files - :ref:`FASTQ <fastq>`, :ref:`BAM/CRAM <bam>`, :ref:`VCF <vcf>` and :ref:`many other file formats <data-types>` (including non-genomic files). 

For Illumina data ``.bam`` and ``.fastq.gz`` files, the typical gain over gzip is around 4X. For PacBio and Oxford Nanopore data aligned ``.bam`` files, the gain is typically around 2X. For ``.vcf.gz`` files, the gain over gzip is typically 3-6X. Here are some :ref:`examples <benchmarks>`.

**Yes**, Genozip can compress already-compressed files (.gz .bz2 .xz .bam .cram).

The compression is **lossless** - the decompressed file is 100% identical to the original file (some :ref:`exceptions<losslessness>` apply).

Genozip consists of four command line tools:
  
   * :doc:`genozip` compresses files
  
   * :doc:`genounzip` decompresses files

   * :doc:`genols` shows metadata of compressed files and directories

   * :doc:`genocat` is the workhorse for using genozip in analytical pipelines:
      - Display the contents of a compressed file
      - Subset a compressed file - show a specific part of its contents
      - Translate a compressed file to another format (eg BAM to FASTQ)
      - Analyze a compressed file (eg showing the :ref:`sex<sex>` or :ref:`coverage<coverage>`)
